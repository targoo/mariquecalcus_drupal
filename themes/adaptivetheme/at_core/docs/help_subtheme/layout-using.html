<h1>Configuring Layouts in Appearance Settings</h1>

<p>Adaptivetheme uses "layouts" to set the regions and CSS layout for a page. This can be for the default page and template suggestions.</p>

<p>Bascially it works like this: you choose default or template suggestion from the select list, then choose a layout, decide if you need to support IE8, then save the configuration. If you can do that, you can change your themes layout.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Default Page Layout</h2>

<p>The first step is to configure the default page layout. This will re-write your themes <code>page.html.twig</code> file with new markup (twig) and inject any new regions into your themes <code>info.yml</code> file. Backups are always made before this happens and are stored in the /backup/ directory in your theme. You can switch off automatic backups in your themes settings if you prefer not to bother.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose "Default" from the Page Type options.</li>
  <li>Select a layout.</li>
  <li>Configure Internet Explorer Options.</li>
  <li>Save the configuration.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Changing the Default Page Layout</h3>

<p>At any time you can change the default page layout simply by repeating the process above.</p>

<p>NOTE: if you have existing template suggestions and now want to change the default to a different <em>plugin</em>, then you must delete all the template suggestions first. Then configure your new default layout, then recreate the template suggestion using layouts from the new plugin.</p>


<h3>Help! My Regions are not showing up in block config!</h3>

<p>Clear the cache <code>admin/config/development/performance</code>. It's really important especially if you changed your layouts code, or chose a default page layout from a new <em>plugin</em>. You must clear the cache so Drupal's block system can "see" and use the new regions.</p>

<h2>Template Suggestions</h2>

<p>Drupal supports something called "template suggestions". These override the default template when invoked, usually when a particular path is visited in the site - for example the front page, user page, forum pages and so on. Template suggestions do not exists by default, you have to create them and this theme provides a very simple way of generating template suggestions.</p>

<p>Creating template suggestions is strait forward:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose "Template Suggestion" from the Page Type options.</li>
  <li>Enter the template suggestion.</li>
  <li>Select a layout - this must be from the same plugin as the default layout.</li>
  <li>Configure Internet Explorer Options.</li>
  <li>Save the configuration.</li>
</ol>

<p>Like the default layout you can change a template suggestions layout simply by repeating the process.</p>


<h3>Available Suggestions</h3>

<p>If you don't know what suggestions are available use the <b>Show Page Suggestions</b> feature, which you will find under the Devel tab. Now when you visit a page you will see 3 or 4 suggestions printed in your themes "messages" area. The one at the top is always the least specific and the one at the bottom the most specific (more specific suggestions override less specific.) For example when you visit the user page for user 1 you should get this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>page__user</b> - applies to http://www.example.com/user</li>
  <li><b>page__user__%</b> - applies to http://www.example.com/user/[n]</li>
  <li><b>page__user__1</b> - applies only to http://www.example.com/user/1</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see that page__user is the least specific, so if you want the suggestion to apply to ALL user pages, that is the one to use, if you only want it to apply to user 1's user page, use page__user__1. This holds true for all page template suggestions. The odd one in the middle with the % (percentage) symbol will match any number.</p>

<p>Another quick example would be for node pages (not node templates, they have their own template suggestions, this is just for the page templates): </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>page__node</b> - matches all nodes.</li>
  <li><b>page__node__article</b> - matches all "article type" nodes (see below).</li>
  <li><b>page__node__1</b> - matches only node/1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few other common suggestions you can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>page__front</b> - site homepage, i.e. http://www.example.com/</li>
  <li><b>page__contact</b> - contact page, i.e. http://www.example.com/contact (using Drupal core Contact module)</li>
  <li><b>page__forum</b> - all forum pages, i.e. http://www.example.com/forum (using Drupal core Forum module)</li>
  <li><b>page__tracker</b> - tracker pages, i.e. http://www.example.com/tracker (using Drupal core Tracker module)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Views module adds a template suggestion for all Views pages and can be seen when using the <b>Show Page Suggestions</b> feature.

<h3>Content Type Page Suggestions</h3>

<p>Adaptivetheme adds a template suggestion for each content type. If you have a content type of "article" the suggestion will be <code>page__node__article</code>. You can find these the same way as other suggestions by using the <em>Show Page Suggestions</em> feature in Devel settings.</p>
