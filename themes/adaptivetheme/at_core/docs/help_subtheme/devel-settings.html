<h1>Devel Settings</h1>

<p>Adaptivetheme includes a number of settings to aid in theme and site development. This section is a quick run down of those settings and how you can use them. Most are self explanatory, except for one - the LiveReload setting. Here we discuss each setting and in particular how to get started with LiveReload.</p>

<hr>


<h2>LiveReload</h2>

<p>LiveReload is an app and browser extension that reloads the page when changes are detected in things like CSS files - this saves you a lot of time and a must have for front end developers. In your sub-theme you will find a toggle to turn support for the LiveReload snippet on and off (you still need the App and browser extensions installed).</p>
