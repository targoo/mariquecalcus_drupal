<p>Adaptivetheme does not require SASS, however you will be able to take maximum advantage of all the tools in this theme if you do. The ELF is written in SASS and all layouts are built using <a href="https://github.com/ericam/susy/tree/susy-next" target="_blank">Susy Next</a> - a SASS based layout framework.</p>

<p>For beginners I recommend reading about SASS and Compass on thier web sites - they both have excellent documentation and there is a plethora of great examples all over the web. I have provided some links below.</p>

<p>Normally you install Ruby, Gems and so on using a command line interface like terminal in OSX - however if you don't want to do this then use <a href="http://mhs.github.io/scout-app/" target="_blank">Scout</a> (which is free) or a similar desktop application - they are actually very user friendly and extremely popular for this reason.</p>

<p>Apps like Scout take a few minutes to install and get started with - they come with all the base requirements for compiling SASS stylesheets and can install dependancies for you - all without ever going near the command line. These are point and click desktop applications.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier Adaptivetheme uses Susy Next, however it's not a hard requirement of using the theme - by starting with something like the Minima layout you easily swap in your favored SASS/LESS/Stylus framework. Page templates are just markup, so use whatever CSS tools you want to lay them out - Adaptivetheme is agnostic and does not care about layout system being employed.</p>

<p>Here's some links to get started using SASS:</p>
