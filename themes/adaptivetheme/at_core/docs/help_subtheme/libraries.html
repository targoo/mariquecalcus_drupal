<h1>Libraries</h1>

<p>Adaptivetheme allows you to load theme and Drupal core libraries via theme settings. This help section explains how to use the Libraries feature and how to add a library to your theme.</p>

<hr>


<h2>What is a Library?</h2>

<p>A library is either an JS or CSS files (or both). For example a jQuery plugin can be a library. For example Drupal core treats all its jQuery plugins as libraries. To create a library simply create a folder and place your files inside that folder - the only requirement is that they are all directly in the root of that folder, not in sub-folders.</p>

<h2>How to declare a Library?</h2>

<p>TODO: write help on how to declare libraries in yml files: https://drupal.org/node/2148679.</p>


<h2>Drupal Core Libraries</h2>

<p>Drupal core provides many libraries and none are loaded by default on any page in Drupal, ever, not even jQuery. You will see in the Libraries tab of your sub-theme a field for Drupal core libraries - here are listed all the commonly used libraries for front end development that Drupal provides. If your library has a hard dependency such as jQuery you should turn it on here. Your plugin might be working when you are logged in because jQuery is loading for the Toolbar, but logout and it might not be, so make sure you get your dependencies loading as well.</p>

<h2>How does this differ from using drupal_add_library()</h2>

<p>TODO</p>

<h2>How are the library files actually loaded?</h2>

<p>AT Core loads the files in hook_page_alter() using #attached.</p>
