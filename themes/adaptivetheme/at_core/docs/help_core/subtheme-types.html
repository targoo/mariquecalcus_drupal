  <h1>Starterkits</h1>

  <p>Adaptivetheme supports three Starterkit types - "Standard", "Minimal" and "Skin".</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Standard</h2>

  <p>The standard type is great for site builders and those who do not want to build layout. Using the Standard starterkit you can build your entire site and then hand off to the themer to add the design styles.</p>

  <p>For themers this is also a great start - you get a very robust layouts, extra tools like SASS support and can build out themes very quickly.</p>

  <p>The Standard starterkit ships with three layouts that all have 22 regions. You can configure many different sites and layouts merely by placing blocks in regions and using Drupal cores excellent block visibility settings. Adpativethemes will also provide a Layouts repository on Github where you will be able to download and install new layouts for your themes - this is currently in development and we're hoping it becomes a large repository of hundreds of layouts.</p>

  <p>All themes are supported by AT Cores "Libraries" feature - this allows you to drop any "library" (a collection of JavaScript and/or CSS files) into a folder call "/libraries/" in the root of your sub-theme and they will immediately be available in your theme settings where you can toggle them on and off. This makes adding things like jQuery plugins trivial. See help section for "Libraries" in your sub-theme for more details, or the README in the /libraries/ folder of your theme. Note that this feature includes the ability to toggle Drupal core libraries on and off also.</p>

  <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Three advanced Layouts (easily add more from the Layout library or build your own)</li>
    <li>Responsive in mobile and small screens</li>
    <li>SASS Support (normal CSS files also)</li>
    <li>Layouts built with <a href="http://oddbird.net/tags/2.0/" target="_blank">Susy</a></li>
    <li>Extra SASS mixins e.g. visually-hidden, image-replace</li>
    <li>Libraries support</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Standard type is really designed for rapid site and theme development, if you're in a hurry then this is a good choice.</p>

  <h2>Minimal</h2>

  <p>As per the name, the Minimal starterkit has fewer features and will suite Front End Developers. The major difference is that it ships with just one simple layout, so is really designed for those wanting to build their own Layout right from the start.</p>

  <p>The included layout is built with <a href="http://oddbird.net/tags/2.0/" target="_blank">Susy Next</a> (Susy version 2), however it's so basic you can easily switch to using your own bespoke layout CSS, or use your usual SASS framework such as Zen Grids, Zurb Foundation, Twitter Bootstrap etc.</p>

  <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>One responsive layout</li>
    <li>SASS Support (normal CSS files also)</li>
    <li>Layout built with <a href="http://oddbird.net/tags/2.0/" target="_blank">Susy</a></li>
    <li>Extra SASS mixins e.g. visually-hidden, image-replace</li>
    <li>Libraries support</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Skin</h2>

  <p>Skins are intended to be sub sub-themes. They only have one template - a page.html.twig since this is very important in Adaptivetheme for supporting the Layouts Extension. Sub-themes can have their own layouts and you can generate Layouts and template suggestions just for your skin - bascially they are fully fledged themes like any other, but we strip out some stuff that's not needed since its inherited from it's base theme.</p>

  <p>The original intention of Skins was to be a replacement for <a href="https://drupal.org/project/footheme" target="_blank">Footheme</a>, i.e. to be an easy way to sub-theme existing Color module enabled sub-themes. At this time Skins are still in development and not well tested.</p>

  <p>First you must generate (or manually create) and theme based on the Standard or Minimal starterkit, then you will get the option to select the Skin type.</p>

  <p>When you select "Skin" the generator wizard will show you a list of available base themes.</p>


  <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Inherit their base themed settings and template overrides</li>
    <li>SASS Support (normal CSS files also)</li>
    <li>Libraries support</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Important!</strong> When generating Skin type themes you must update the <code>info.yml</code> file - specifically the stylesheets and scripts information. There is currently an unresolved issue with the theme that stylesheets are the same name as the source theme (since we literally clone the source theme and remove and rename some things). This will be resolved shortly - first I had to build a function that properly writes yml info files and that has been done (to support the Layouts system) and now we can actually do things like the properly rather than hacking.</p>
