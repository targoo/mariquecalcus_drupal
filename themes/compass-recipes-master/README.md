# [Compass Recipes](http://compass-recipes.moox.fr/) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/MoOx/compass-recipes.png)](http://travis-ci.org/MoOx/compass-recipes)

A series of Compass and Sass mixins and functions for creating delicious CSS effects.

_Compass Recipes is currently under active development. While it's being already used on multiple projects (even in production), you may encounter some issues. Please try it out in a project, and [make suggestions](https://github.com/MoOx/compass-recipes/issues/new) or [report bugs](https://github.com/MoOx/compass-recipes/issues) ! Your feedback matters._

## [Online Demos](http://compass-recipes.moox.fr/tests/recipes/)

If you want to view the Sass(scss) source of a demo, remember to find the appropriate `.scss` file of the deserved `s.css` (e.g. : open it from the source & switch extension).

## Installation

[Compass Recipes is available as a gem on RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/compass-recipes), so installation is quite easy.

```shell
(sudo) gem install compass-recipes
```

*If you want all latests recipes, you can just checkout the recipes (or download as zip) and add '{your-path-here-or-./}compass-recipes/stylesheets' using `additional_import_paths` or `add_import_path` (see [Compass configuration reference](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/configuration-reference/)).

More informations on the [Wiki](https://github.com/MoOx/compass-recipes/wiki)*


## Usage

When compass-recipes installed, you just need to require the compass plugin in your project

```ruby
require 'compass-recipes'
```

Then you can include some recipes like this

```scss
@import "recipes/shape/polygon/triangle";
.my-triangle
{
    @include triangle;
}
```

Like Compass does, you can include all recipes in a folder like this

```scss
@import "recipes/shape";

.my-triangle
{
    @include triangle;
}

.my-square
{
    @include square;
}
```

## Support/Community

Compass Recipes has for now a little community because this projet is (for now) only at the beginning.

[@Compass_Recipes](https://twitter.com/#!/Compass_Recipes) on _Twitter_ is a great place to ask very short questions that you want answered quickly.

There is also an IRC channel, **#compass-recipes** on _irc.freenode.net_.

Feel free to ping @MoOx if he’s there to get his attention quickly. If there’s no one on **#compass-recipes**, you can try the **#compass** or maybe the **#sass** channel on IRC.

If you have a longer question (or no one’s around on IRC at the moment), drop a mail at [compass-recipes@moox.fr](mailto:compass-recipes@moox.fr). You’ll usually get a response within a couple hours or so.

## Open to All

If you have a nifty CSS trick that makes sense to be abstracted (and isn't already in another Github repo), please fork and submit a pull request. Note: If you are not the author of the CSS trick, you must get their permission before adding.

## Fonts

All fonts are repackaged using [Fontsquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator).
Licences are distributed with the fonts.

## Build Documentation

*You do not need to build documentation for testing your recipes.*
*Just run `compass watch/compile` at the root of the repository.*

First you need bundle

```bundle install```

Then, to build the gh-pages from the `tests/`, you need to call

```bundle exec rake pages```

This process create the pages & commit them to your gh-pages branch.

## Authors/Maintainers

Compass Recipes is maintained by [Maxime Thirouin](http://moox.fr), a french front-end web developer, and [David Kaneda](http://www.davidkaneda.com), previously creative director at [Sencha](http://www.sencha.com).
