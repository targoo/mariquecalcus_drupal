The form api in Drupal 8 is still awesome and very rich.


//use Drupal\Core\Form\FormBuilderInterface;

//or you can extends the baseform

//\Drupal::formBuilder()->getForm('Drupal\mc_form\Form\myform');

//In Drupal 8, form definition functions are all grouped together inside a class which can extends the baseform to make ruse
// the
// Drupal 8 will support a number of the new HTML5 input element types and we will review them.

// If you have build form with the Drupal 7 or even 6 Api it should be easy as the api didn't change that much.

Properties always start with a #. Anything that doesn't is treated as an element.
Elements and #properties are the basis of all forms.

You can already start using them today. Indeed if they are not supported, they will behave as regular text fields.

There is a more compelling reason to start to use today. Soft keyboard that are render in module devices will be opimize for the
current input text providing a  better usability experiance.

You also get build in validation rule.

Drupal does support almost all the new HTML5 input text and if it does they may be some work around.
